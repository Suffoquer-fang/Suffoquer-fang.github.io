My name is Yan Fang (方言). I am currently a third-year master student at THUIR Lab, Tsinghua University. In June this year, I will graduate and embark on my journey as a deep learning engineer. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. My research revolves around Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on dense retrieval and large language models. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, machine/deep learning systems. You can find my CV [here](/assets/cv.pdf).
