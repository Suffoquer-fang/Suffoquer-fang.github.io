My name is Yan Fang (方言). I am currently a deep learning engineer focusing on fintech. I obtained my Master's degree from THUIR Lab in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, where I also completed my Bachelor's degree. My research revolves around Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on dense retrieval and large language models. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, machine/deep learning systems. You can find my CV [here](/assets/cv.pdf).
